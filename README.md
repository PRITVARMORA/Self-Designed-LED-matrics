# Self-Designed-LED-matrix
   I have worked on this project during my 1st year in B. Tech In order to develop Logic power in C language this two different projects have been carried out with self designed 8*6 LED matrix.
   
# Folder: Sliding_characters 
  This folder contains files for Sliding character project. 
  The project has started to play with led 2-D LED Array display. It simply displays, sliding characters given as input from the serial monitor. No library has been used. The hardware has optimized to reduce the number of used MCU pins.
  
# Folder: Snake-dot game
  This folder contains files for Sliding character project. 
  The aim to make this game was to develop logical skills in programming. A snake controlled by push buttons eats dots to grow longer without crashing into the walls.  It has optimized to reduce the number of the used pins (48 LEDs controlled using 9 pins of the MCU), required ROM and processing power of the MCU.
  
  ===> The full program and logic is self developed without using any external sources.
